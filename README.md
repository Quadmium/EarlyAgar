# EarlyAgar
Agar.Javo but intended for a template for networking

This is an extremely early version of the Agar.Javo repository with an added chat feature.

The code should be good for anyone who needs to know how to communicate between server / client through TCP strings.

Notes:
Client code in AgarPanel.java
Server code in Server.java and User.java
Since this is an early version, things will nullpointer and crash with unexpected cases. Only use this for a general sense of how to code networking!
